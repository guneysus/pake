# pake
Just another Make but with Powershell


- create a file called `pake.ps1`
- define functions
- a global exe will parse its contents and autocompletes functions (and may autocomplete parameters)


## TODOs

- [ ] default task
- [ ] multiple virtual targets like `all`
- [ ] passing parameters (no limitations but should test)
- [ ] functions without `function` keyword
